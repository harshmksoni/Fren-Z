# Fren-Z
For the Fren-Z food ordering application, I utilized my proficiency in Java, particularly with Core Java and Swing for creating a desktop-based user interface. The project involved building a multi-role platform where users such as sellers, customers, and delivery agents could interact seamlessly. I used Java Swing to design a responsive and intuitive graphical user interface, which allowed different roles to access the platform based on their specific needs. To handle database operations, I applied JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) Thin Driver to ensure efficient communication between the application and the Oracle database. This facilitated real-time updates for inventory management, order processing, and user profiles, ensuring that data was accurately retrieved and stored. For instance, I designed the database schema to support the three roles (Seller, Customer, and Delivery Staff), handling data such as customer orders, seller inventories, and delivery statuses. My experience with Java developer tools like NetBeans helped streamline the development process. I also applied object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, ensuring modularity and flexibility within the system, making it scalable for future updates. Overall, the Fren-Z application allowed me to apply my Java development skills in a practical, user-focused context, combining backend database management with a frontend GUI interface and external API integration to deliver a comprehensive food ordering solution.
